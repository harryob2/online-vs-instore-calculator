# online-vs-instore-calculator
The source code for a tool I built to determine whether you should shop online or in-person. It's built entirely out of HTML and Javascript,. To see it in action, click [here](http://www.harryobrien.eu/shopping-calculator).

For a video explaining the code, click [here](https://youtu.be/iwr4dF8qiC4).

This was a cool side project, and useful for learning how to run calculations on user inputted values with javascript.
